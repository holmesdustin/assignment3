# Assignment 3
This is Server-Side Web class assignment 3 which creates a website to display a random XKCD cartoon.
I use node.js with express along with request packet from npm to connect to the API and pull back the JSON,
and I use the JSON to get the image URL and use that to display the image in an image tag.
This will be displayed in a webpage built using Bootstrap. The website is also mobile friendly.

## Requirements
"From the JSON obtained I want you to display the title of the comic, the year it was published and the comic itself.
The comic should be centered, you should implement a nav bar and also a jumbotron.
You should also implement a button that refreshes the comic displayed on the page with another random one."
                           -- Dr. Canedo
## Implementation Tools
* Bootstrap to style the website
* API used from XKCD: http://xkcd.com/info.0.json (current comic)
